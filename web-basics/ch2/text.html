    <p> This paragraph will display <b>bold</b> text.</p>
    <p> This one will show <i>italicized</i> text.</p>
    <p> Let's checkout superscripts and subscripts. Both the
       <sup>supercript</sup> and the <sub>subscript</sub> are helpful for
       <sup>math</sup> and <sub>science</sub>. And what about
       <sup>a<sub>combo</sub></sup>? Or <sub>this<sup>one</sup></sub>

    <h1>Looking at Whitespace</h1>
    <p>The moon is drifting away from the Earth.</p>
    <p>The moon      is drifting    away from the   Earth.</p>
    <p>The
  moon is drifting                    away from the     Earth.</p>

    <p>All three of the previous lines were written using different
    whitespace.</p>

    <h1>Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules</h1>
    <p>The Earth<br />gets one hundred tons heavier every day<br />due to
    falling space dust.</p>

    <p>Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Jupiter is bigger than all the<br />other<br />planets combined.</p>

    <h1>Semantic Markup</h1>
    <p>Text elements that do not change the structure of your page but
    <i>do</i> add extra information are known as semantic markup.</p>

    <p>Both <strong>strong</strong> and <em>emphasis</em> have a variety of
    ways that can be displayed by the browser or can be styled in the css
    sheet.</p>

     <blockquote><p>`&lt;blockquote&gt;` is usually used for longer quotes that end
        up taking up lots and lots and lots and lots and lotsand lots and lots
        and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
        lots and lots and lots of room.</p></blockquote>

    <p><abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>
    is an example of an abbreviation/acronym that will display the
    definition by hovering! Pretty neat.</p>

    <p><cite>War and Peace</cite> is a long novel by Leo Tolstoy.</p>

    <p>A <dfn>define tag</dfn> indicates the defining instance of a term.</p>

    <p>I really like the <s>strikethrough</s> tag.</p>
